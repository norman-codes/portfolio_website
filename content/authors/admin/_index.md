my name is **norman bukingolts**, and i'm a third-year computer science major at the university of florida. (go gators! :man_student: :crocodile:)

this website, in addition to my [GitHub](https://github.com/norman-codes), exists as proof that, in fact, *norman codes*. :man_technologist:\
here, I exhibit my work in more thorough detail (and aesthetic presentation! :sparkles:) than my {{< staticref "uploads/BukingoltsNorman_Resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}resume{{< /staticref >}} can reasonably hold. :scroll:
